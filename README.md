# Pygame TowerDefense

My second game developed to learn and improve my programming skills
Requires python 2.7 and pygame 1.9.2a0 win32 bit: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

Uses pytmx version 3.20 to allow loading of .tmx map files. pytmx is licensed under LGPL v3:  https://github.com/bitcraft/PyTMX

To update the pytmx library, download the newest build from https://github.com/bitcraft/PyTMX and replace the pytmx folder
with the pytmx folder from bitcraft's repository.
 
Updating pytmx possibly requires you to modifiy the tilerenderer.py file.

pytmx additionally uses the "six"-module by "gutworth". "six" is licensed under MIT: https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six


Controls:

Left click a tower button at the bottom to choose a tower to place. When no tower is selected, left click an allready placed tower to select it.
Right click to unselect towers. While a placed tower is selected, left click one of the appearing upgrade buttons to upgrade it.

The art is placeholder art made by myself.
